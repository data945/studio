# **App Name**: Synergistic Life Engine

## Core Features:

- Time-Block Scheduler: A visual timeline to display pre-defined time blocks with smart reminders and dynamic rescheduling.
- Domain-Specific Tracking: Modules for tracking deep work, projects, fitness, vocal practice, photography, YouTube lectures, sleep, nutrition, and expenses.
- Adaptive Progression: Automatically increases difficulty/challenge across all domains based on performance history.
- Cross-Domain Insights: Identify correlations between different life domains (e.g., sleep and math problem-solving speed) using a predictive scheduling tool to suggest optimal times for activities.
- Voice-First Interface: Primary input method using voice commands with transcription for frictionless logging.
- Offline-First Architecture: Full app functionality available offline with seamless syncing when internet is available.
- Automated logging: Ability to log some events through external APIs. The system will watch data streams, recognize specific actions, and then auto-log them into the appropriate life domain category.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to inspire trust and productivity.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean, distraction-free interface.
- Accent color: Vivid teal (#00BCD4) for interactive elements and important notifications.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface, will provide a modern and objective aesthetic.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons to represent each domain and action.
- Employ a modular grid layout to organize information clearly across different modules.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback without disrupting focus.
